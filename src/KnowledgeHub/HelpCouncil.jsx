            <h3>Tips to Reduce Food Waste</h3>
            <p><strong>Buy what you need:</strong> Plan your meals, write shopping lists, and avoid impulse purchases. This will help you save money, reduce waste, and ensure that your meals are well-planned.</p>
            <p><strong>Store food wisely:</strong> Rotate the food in your fridge, freezer, and pantry so that older items are used first. Check expiration dates regularly and consider freezing food that you may not be able to use right away.</p>

            <h3>Composting</h3>
            <p><strong>What is Composting?</strong> Composting is the process of breaking down organic material, such as food scraps and garden waste, into a nutrient-rich soil conditioner.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Start:</strong> Start composting by using compost bins, worm farms, or bokashi bins. These systems can break down organic waste efficiently and are easy to maintain.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Save money on garden fertilizers, reduce landfill waste, and improve soil health by using your own compost.</p>

            <h3>Segregate Your Waste</h3>
            <p><strong>Proper Disposal:</strong> Throw food and garden waste only in green bins. Ensure that recyclables are clean and placed in the correct bins to reduce contamination.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Council Services:</strong> Order free kitchen caddies and compostable liners from your council. Use these tools to make separating waste easy and efficient.</p>
            <p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Proper waste segregation reduces landfill, recycles valuable materials, and helps create a sustainable environment.</p>
