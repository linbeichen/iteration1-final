            <h2>What is EcoPantry?</h2>
            <p>Rising food waste and environmental awareness are driving Melbourne councils toward sustainable living. However, poor food waste segregation leads to methane emissions from landfills, harming the environment. With rising food prices and increasing food insecurity among Australian families, it's vital to implement systems that reduce waste, empower families to contribute to sustainability, and manage household expenses.

EcoPantry helps families manage their pantries, reduce food waste, and support their councils' eco-friendly efforts.
